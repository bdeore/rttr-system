# Real Time Transit Redirection System (RTTRS)

Every day, millions of people rely on public transport systems to travel which are managed by government. It is cost efficient way to commute, but a highly unreliable one. More often than not, buses are packed on some routes, while are empty on others. Our aim is to change this scenario by making use of analytics. This system takes into account the number of people travelling on a particular route and then assigns priority to routes accordingly. Different algorithms are used to address density of commuters on the route. 


 Real-Time Transit Redirection System consists of four important components which are interconnected via 802.11 hotspot for internet access. These components are:

1)	Java based Desktop Client.
2)	Standalone Microcntroller devices installed on Bus.
3)	Interconnected Microcontroller Units installed on Bus-Stops.
4)	Centralized Database for Storing Information (Google Cloud Platform) .
 
 All of these units are automated in their functions and provide data directly to client application platform. This data will be further processed by use of algorithms and will directly provide actionable insights.
